<h1>Welcome to Skibidi Toilet Lore!</h1>
<p>It all started with one toilet. A normal toilet.<br>No face nor soul. That was until he was thrust into this cold, dark world.<br>He was created through a harmless senior prank. A student was dunked into the toilet named Skibidadia Marcusia<br>His soul and head were fused into the toilet because this was no ordinary toilet. <br>It was an IKEA toilet.</p>
